# COSC-2418 Final Project

## About:

This is a project for hosting a website for the Casper College STEM Learning Center. It provides a timetable that shows when tutors are available, and what subjects they tutor. It also allows for signing in and out so that hours can be logged. Although it is specific to Casper College, it can easily be altered for other uses.

## Features:

- Sign in/ Sign out functionality, record student times etc
- A timetable that displays tutoring availability.
- A BEAUTIFUL homepage that combines these functions into one place

## User Accounts Tutorial:

Much of the account app was derived from this very helpful tutorial from OPENCLASSROOMS.

## Notable Mention:

Although Alexandre's tutorial did not end up in the final product, it was very helpful in getting started as well as being very informative of Django's capabilities.

## Installation:

1. Make sure that Python 3 is installed

    Open a terminal to check and see if python is properly installed:

                python --version

    If Python is not installed, or not on version 3, visit the [Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download

    If you are on Windows and have installed Python but it is still not working, make sure that Python has been added to Windows PATH.
    [Here is a useful tutorial for adding Python to your PATH](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-add-python-to-windows-path/)

    If it is still not working, use "py" instead of "python" when entering commands into your terminal, like so:

                py --version

    In addition, some may need to use "python3" instead of "python" when entering commands, like so:

                python3 --version

2. Clone repository or download files through Github

3. Make sure that requirements are met

    In your terminal:

    Update pip

                python -m pip install --upgrade pip

    Make sure you are in the proper directory, and install required addons
    
                pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Make migrations

    In your terminal:

                python manage.py migrate

5. Run server

    In your terminal:

                python manage.py runserver

6. Visit the website

    After the server is running, visit [this link](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to see it in action
